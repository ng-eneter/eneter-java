/**
 * A kind of collection that can insert or remove element at both ends("double
 * ended queue"). Mostly a deque has no limit of its size.
 *
 * <p>Extending from Queue, a deque can be used as a Queue which behavior is
 * first-in-first-out. Furthermore, a deque can also be used as a Stack(legacy
 * class) which behavior is last-in-first-out.
 *
 * <p>A typical deque does not allow null to be inserted as its element, while some
 * implementations allow it. But null should not be inserted even in these
 * implementations, since method poll return null to indicate that there is no
 * element left in the deque.
 *
 * <p>A deque can also remove interior elements by removeFirstOccurrence and
 * removeLastOccurrence methods. A deque can not access elements by index.
 *
 * @param <E>
 *            the type of elements in this collection
 * @since 1.6
