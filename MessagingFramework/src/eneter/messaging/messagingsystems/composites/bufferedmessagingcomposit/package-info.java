/**
 * Extension for automatic reconnect and buffering of sent messages in case the connection is not available.
 * 
 *
 * The buffered messaging is intended to temporarily store sent messages until the network connection is established.<br/>
 * Typical scenarios are:
 * <br/><br/>
 * <b>Short disconnections</b><br/>
 * In case of unstable network the connection can be broken. Buffered messaging will try to recover the broken connection
 * and meanwhile it will store sent messages to the buffer. Then when the connection is reopen it will send messages from
 * the buffer.
 * <br/><br/>
 * <b>Independent startup order</b><br/>
 * In case your SW system consists of multiple applications which need to communicate it can be problematic
 * to start them in a certain order so that communicating parts are available.
 * To get rid of the startup order dependency you can use the buffered messaging. If messages are sent
 * to an application which is not started yet they will be stored in the buffer until the application is started.
