/**
 * Extension providing buffering of sent messages for cases the connection is not available.
 * 
 *
 * The buffered messaging is intended to temporarily store sent messages until the network connection is established.<br/>
 * Typical scenarios are:
 * <br/><br/>
 * <b>Short disconnections</b><br/>
 * In case of unstable the network the connection can broken. Buffered messaging will try to reconnect the broken connection
 * and meanwhile it will store sent messages in the buffer. Then when the connection is repaired it will send messages from
 * the buffer.
 * <br/><br/>
 * <b>Independent startup order</b><br/>
 * It can be tricky to start communicating application in a defined order. Buffered messaging allows to start
 * applications in undefined order. If messages are sent to an application which is not started yet they will be stored
 * in the buffer until the application is started.
